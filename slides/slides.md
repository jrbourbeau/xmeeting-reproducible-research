## Comments on reproducibility

- Same inputs give the same output.

- Code can easily run by someone else.

- Environment needed to run code can be created easily.

## Topics

- Python packages

- Making packages `pip`-installable

- Virtual environments

- Writing tests with `pytest`


# Python packages

## Python packages

- A Python package is a directory containing:

    1. `.py` files containing Python code (called "modules")
    2. `__init__.py` file.

- I.e. a package is a collection of modules.
- Can act as a useful organizational tool to centralize code.
- We'll talk more about `__init__.py` later...

## Example Python package

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

- For example, a Python package could look like

```

    expackage/
        |- __init__.py
        |- math.py
```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
```python
    # math.py
    def my_add(a, b):
        return a + b
```
:::
::::::::::::::


## Importing a package

- While in the same directory as a Python package, you can `import` and use the code inside package modules.

- Dot syntax (`<package>.<module>`) is used to access the module namespace.

```python
    >>> from expackage.math import my_add
    >>> my_add(2, 3)
    5
```

## So what's `__init__.py` for?

- The contents of `expackage/__init__.py` are run whenever `expackage` is imported.

- Any code can be placed in `__init__.py`.

- Often used to lift code from the module-level namespace up into the top-level package namespace (example on next slide).

## Lifting module code into package namespace

- Import code from modules inside `__init__.py`.

```python
    # __init__.py
    from .math import my_add
```

- Now available at the top-level namespace.

```python
    >>> import expackage
    >>> expackage.my_add(2, 3)
    5
```

## `import`-ing troubles

- Will run into issues when you're not in the same directory as `expackage`.

```python
    >>> import expackage
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'expackage'
```

- How does Python find packages?

## How does Python find packages?

- Question: How does Python find packages?

- Answer: It looks in `sys.path`

```python
    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.path
    ['',
     '/usr/local/lib/python36.zip',
     '/usr/local/lib/python3.6',
     '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/plat-darwin',
     '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/lib-dynload',
     '/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages']
```

## How is `sys.path` constructed?

- `sys.path` includes:

    1. The current working directory.
    2. Anything specified in the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.
    3. Site-specific paths (`site.py` module)

- I don't recommend messing with the `PYTHONPATH` variable unless you absolutely have to.
    - See [PYTHONPATH Considered Harmful](https://orbifold.xyz/pythonpath.html) blog post.

## Installing Python packages

- `pip` is the recommended Python package installer.

- Installs packages into `site-packages/` directory by default.

- Easy to use `pip` (e.g. `pip install numpy`).

- `pip` knows about versions.
    - Latest version: `pip install numpy`
    - Specific version: `pip install numpy==1.13.0`
    - Minimum version: `pip install numpy>=1.11.1`

- Also works with version control systems.
    - `pip install git+https://github.com/numpy/numpy.git#egg=numpy`

## Requirements files

- Requirements files are files containing a list of items to be installed using `pip install`.

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Effectively, each line in a requirements file gets passed to `pip install`.

```
    # requirements.txt
    numpy==1.11.0
    matplotlib
    scikit-learn>=0.18.2
```

# Making packages `pip`-installable

## Making a Python package installable with `pip`

- To make your own Python package installable with `pip`, you need a `setup.py` file.

```python
    # setup.py
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        name='expackage',
        description='Example Python package',
        packages=['expackage'],
    )
```

- `pip` and `setuptools` are included with Python 2 >= 2.7.9 and Python 3 >= 3.4.

## Specifying package dependencies

```python
    # setup.py
    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        name='expackage',
        description='Example Python package',
        packages=['expackage'],
        install_requires=['numpy==1.13.0',
                          'matplotlib',
                          'scikit-learn>=0.18.2']
    )
```

## Standard package layout

- Typically, there's a top level directory that contains the `setup.py` file, the actual Python package, and any additional files (e.g. `README`, license, etc).

```
    expackage/
        setup.py
        README.md
        expackage/
            |- __init__.py
            |- math.py
```

- It's convention to have the package name and top level directory name to match, but it's not required.

- Not quite ready to `pip install expackage` yet.


# Virtual environments

## Why use virtual environments?

- Different projects have different dependencies.

    - Project A needs `pandas==0.18.0`.

    - Project B needs `pandas==0.16.0`.

- You canâ€™t install packages into the global `site-packages/` directory. For instance, on a shared host.

## What is a virtual environment?

- Isolated Python environment with its own separate version of `pip` that installs packages into its own `site-packages/` directory.

- Virtual environments don't talk to each other.

- Each project you work on can have its own Python packages installed separately.

    - Project A can have `pandas==0.18.0`

    - Project B can have `pandas==0.16.0`.

## Mental picture of virtual environments

![Virtual environments are isolated from one another. Packages installed into Project A's virtual environment can't be used in Project B, and vice versa.](images/virtual-envs.pdf)


## How to create a virtual environment

- Depends on which version of Python you are using.

- Python 3.3+ has a `venv` module build into the standard library.

```bash
    $ python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/project-a
    $ source ~/.venvs/project-a/bin/activate
    (project-a) $
```

- Python 2.6+ and Python 3.3+ should use the third party `virtualenv` package (open source and maintained by the Python Packaging Authority).

```bash
    $ pip install virtualenv
    $ virtualenv ~/.venvs/project-a
    $ source ~/.venvs/project-a/bin/activate
    (project-a) $
```

## They really are isolated!

```bash
$ which python
/usr/local/bin/python

$ source ~/.venvs/project-a/bin/activate

(project-a) $ which python
/Users/jbourbeau/.venvs/project-a/bin/python

(project-a) $ which pip
/Users/jbourbeau/.venvs/project-a/bin/pip
```


# Writing tests with `pytest`

## What are tests?

- Software tests are checks that test the quality of your code.

    - Unit tests &mdash; test that a specific function is working as expected.

    - Usability tests &mdash; test that code interacts as expected with the user.

- Tests are useful to make sure that your code works as expected. Also ensures that future changes made to your code don't break it in unexpected ways.

## Testing tools

- There is a [`unittest` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) built into the Python standard library.  

- `pytest` is a framework for writing tests for Python code.

    - Easy to install: `pip install pytest`.

    - Light-weight syntax for writing tests.

    - Large plugin community.

    - Supports running `unittest` tests.


## Writing our first test

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

```
    expackage/
        setup.py
        README.md
        expackage/
            |- __init__.py
            |- math.py
            |- tests/
                |- test_math.py
```

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
```python
    # test_math.py
    from expackage import my_add

    def test_my_add():
        assert my_add(3, 2) == 5
```
:::
::::::::::::::

## Running tests with `pytest`

- Use the `pytest` command to run your tests.

- Starts in specified directory (current working directory otherwise) and looks for `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` files.

    - `pytest expackage` will run all tests in `expackage/*/test_*.py` or `expackage/*/*_test.py` files.

- `pytest` has many useful command line options.

    - `pytest -sv expackage`


## Adding some input verification

```python
def my_add(a, b):

    if not isinstance(a, (int, float)):
        raise TypeError('Input to my_add should be '
                        'either integers or floats')

    return a + b
```

## Testing for failure

```python
# test_math.py
import pytest
from expackage import my_add

def test_my_add():
    assert my_add(3, 2) == 5

def test_my_add_first_input_raises():
    with pytest.raises(TypeError) as excinfo:
        my_add('not a number', 5)
    error = ('Input to my_add should be either '
             'integers or floats')
    assert error == str(excinfo.value)
```
